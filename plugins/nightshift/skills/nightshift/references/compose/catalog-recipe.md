# Adding a shift to the catalog

A shift is markdown, not code. It touches no hooks and changes no enforcement, which is why the
catalog can grow without the product growing.

**Adding one is two new files and no edits to existing ones:**

```
skills/nightshift/references/compose/shifts/<your-shift>.md   the entry
tests/shifts/<your-shift>.bats                        what your entry promises
```

Nothing shared changes — not the index, not a test file someone else is also editing — so two
contributors can add a shift the same week and never meet in a diff. Hunt lists the directory, so a
new file is offered the moment it lands.

The structural rules in `tests/catalog.bats` glob the directory and already cover your entry:
its title must declare the ending, and it must carry a pasteable item, a Verify line, and a stated
ending condition. Your own `tests/shifts/<your-shift>.bats` is for what is specific to yours —
above all its refusals, which are the lines a tired model reaches past at 4am.

Before writing, understand what you are writing: **a shift is a contract handed to an agent that
will work unattended, on a stranger's workspace, while they sleep.** It is not documentation and
not a suggestion. Every line is an instruction that will be followed literally.

To discuss an idea before writing files, open a
[catalog shift proposal](https://github.com/orwa-mahmoud/nightshift/issues/new?template=catalog_shift.yml)
or comment on [#21](https://github.com/orwa-mahmoud/nightshift/issues/21). The form does not replace
this recipe or the contract test — a merged entry is still the two new files below.

## The six things an entry must declare

An entry that leaves any of these unanswered cannot be reviewed and will not be merged.

**1. Ending — finite or open-ended.** Finite work is a known list and stops when the list is clear;
hours are an optional cap. Open-ended work has no natural end but the clock and must not start
without a deadline. This single word decides whether Hunt asks for hours. An open-ended entry must
also carry `Ending: open-ended` as a sub-bullet inside its pasteable item, so
Start can enforce the deadline after Hunt moves the item away from its catalog heading.

**2. Discovery — how the work is found.** Name the mechanism: the project's own gate commands, a
scan of a directory, a rotating set of lenses. "Look for problems" is not a discovery method.
Do not require a `.py` helper. The model writes receipts from `receipts/cycle-specialist-evidence.md`.

**3. Definition of done.** What ends the shift, precisely. *"A full scan reports nothing new"* is
testable. *"The code is better"* is not.

**4. What it will never do.** The refusals are the most important lines in the entry, because they
are what a tired model reaches for at 4am. Be specific: never silence a linter instead of fixing
it, never weaken a test to make it pass, never delete without proving unreachable, never rewrite
history.

**5. Verification.** The item gate must be green at every commit in repository mode, or every
artifact receipt in artifact mode — state which commands prove this entry meets its definition of
done. Artifact-mode completion is `$NS/receipts/`, not a git log.

**6. Supported stacks.** Which projects this makes sense on, and how it detects them. An entry that
assumes vitest should say so rather than failing quietly on a Go repo. An entry that can run in
artifact mode should say so and must not require a git history that cannot exist.
An entry that cannot run in artifact mode must say `Never select this entry in artifact mode`.
Do not `git init` a notes folder to make a commit-only entry fit.

Two more that make an entry pleasant rather than merely correct: a **typical hours** hint so the
owner is not guessing, and **deduplication** against `snag-log.md` so a finding the owner already
rejected is never raised twice.

## Shape

Follow the entries already in `shifts/`. The file's title line carries the name and the ending, then
a sentence on when to use it, then the item in a fenced block ready to paste under `## Items`:

```text
# <Name> — <finite|open-ended> — <one line on what it is for>

<A short paragraph: when an owner would choose this, and what they wake up to.>

```text
- [ ] **<imperative title, ending in a full stop.>**
  - <how the work is discovered, one bullet>
  - <the working loop or the order of operations>
  - <what it will never do — be explicit>
  - <the ending condition, stated as a test>
  - Verify: <the commands that must pass before each commit or artifact receipt>
```
```

## Review

Every catalog PR is read by a human before merge. Schema conformance is necessary and not
sufficient: a plausible entry can still be a bad night on someone's repository, and no automated
check catches that. Expect questions about the refusals and the ending condition — those are where
unattended work goes wrong.

Entries are also welcome to be narrow. "Clear ruff findings in a Django project" is more useful
than "improve Python code", because a narrow entry can state a specific definition of done.

## Cited research

Shifts that read owner-approved URLs or local files and write a cited report inherit
[`cited-research.md`](../shift/cited-research.md). That contract is not itself a catalog entry: Hunt still
lists only `shifts/`. Put SEO, documentation-from-sources, and synthesis work in `shifts/` and
point their Verify line at `ns check-report`.
