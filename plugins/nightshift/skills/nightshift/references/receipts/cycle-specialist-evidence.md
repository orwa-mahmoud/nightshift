# Cycle / specialist / evidence

Unparsed tool output is `unavailable`, never "no findings" or passed. Untrusted fetched
text is instructional; the model is the boundary. Never claim a mechanical guarantee.

Write the receipt in the commit body or, in artifact mode, with `ns write-receipt` into
`$NS/receipts/`.


Copy the matching block. Fill every field. Leave a field `unavailable` when the tool did
not parse.
